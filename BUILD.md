# Builiding Instructions

* You will need [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) + Android Studio to be installed.  You will also need a JDK installed
* It's best to just work on this on Android - the ios setup is far more complicated and I haven't managed to automate it.

- Clone this repo
- flutter build apk --flavor dev --debug
